# Getting Started with TensorFlow Model Analysis

*   **For**: Machine Learning Engineers or Data Scientists
*   **who**: want to analyze and understand their TensorFlow models
*   **it is**: a standalone library or component of a TFx pipeline
*   **that**: evaluates models on large amounts of data in a distributed manner
    on the same metrics defined in training. These metrics are compared over
    slices of data, and visualized in Jupyter or Colab notebooks.
*   **unlike**: some model introspection tools like tensorboard that offer model
    introspection

TFMA performs its computations in a distributed manner over large amounts of
data using [Apache Beam](http://beam.apache.org). The following sections
describe how to setup a basic TFMA evaluation pipeline. See
[architecture](architecture.md) more details on the underlying implementation.

## Model Types Supported

TFMA is designed to support tensorflow based models, but can be easily extended
to support other frameworks as well. Historically, TFMA required an
`EvalSavedModel` be created to use TFMA, but the latest version of TFMA supports
multiple types of models depending on the user's needs.
[Setting up an EvalSavedModel](eval_saved_model.md) should only be required if a
`tf.estimator` based model is used and custom training time metrics are
required.

Note that because TFMA now runs based on the serving model, TFMA will no longer
automatically evaluate metrics added at training time. The exception to this
case is if a keras model is used since keras saves the metrics used along side
of the saved model. However, if this is a hard requirement, the latest TFMA is
backwards compatible such at an `EvalSavedModel` can still be run in a TFMA
pipeline.

The following table summarizes the models supported by default:

| Model Type | Standard Training Time Metrics | Custom Training Time Metrics | Standard Post Training Metrics | Custom Post Training Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TF2 (keras)    | Y | Not supported yet. | Y | Y |
| TF2 (generic)  | N/A      | N/A | Y | Y |
| EvalSavedModel (estimator) | Y | Y | Y | Y |

*   Standard metrics refers to metrics that are defined based only on label
    (i.e. `y_true`), prediction (i.e. `y_pred`), and example weight (i.e.
    `sample_weight`).
*   Training Time metrics refers to metrics defined at training time and saved
    with the model (either TFMA EvalSavedModel or keras saved model).
*   Generic TF2 models are custom models that export signatures that can be used
    for inference and are not based on either keras or estimator.

See [FAQ](faq.md) for more information on how to setup and configure these
different model types.

## Examples

### Single Model Evaluation

The following uses `tfma.run_model_analysis` to perform evaluation on a serving
model. For an explanation of the different settings needed see the
[setup](setup.md) guide.

Note: To run with an `EvalSavedModel`, just set `signature_name: "eval"` in the
model spec.

Note: this uses Beam's local runner which is mainly for local, small-scale
experimentation.

```python
# Run in a Jupyter Notebook.
from google.protobuf import text_format

eval_config = text_format.Parse("""
  model_specs {
    # This assumes a serving model with a "serving_default" signature.
    label_key: "label"
    example_weight_key: "weight"
  }
  metrics_spec {
    # This assumes a binary classification model.
    metrics { class_name: "AUC" }
    # ... other metrics ...
  }
  slicing_specs {}
  slicing_specs {
    feature_keys: ["age"]
  }
""", tfma.EvalConfig())

eval_shared_model = tfma.default_eval_shared_model(
    eval_saved_model_path='/path/to/saved/model', eval_config=eval_config)

eval_result = tfma.run_model_analysis(
    eval_shared_model=eval_shared_model,
    eval_config=eval_config,
    # This assumes your data is a TFRecords file containing records in the
    # tf.train.Example format.
    data_location="/path/to/file/containing/tfrecords",
    output_path="/path/for/output")

tfma.view.render_slicing_metrics(eval_result)
```

For distributed evaluation, construct an [Apache Beam](http://beam.apache.org)
pipeline using a distributed runner. In the pipeline, use the
`tfma.ExtractEvaluateAndWriteResults` for evaluation and to write out the
results. The results can be loaded for visualization using
`tfma.load_eval_result`.

For example:

```python
# To run the pipeline.
from google.protobuf import text_format

eval_config = text_format.Parse("""
  model_specs {
    # This assumes a serving model with a "serving_default" signature.
    label_key: "label"
    example_weight_key: "weight"
  }
  metrics_specs {
    # This assumes a binary classification model.
    metrics { class_name: "AUC" }
    # ... other metrics ...
  }
  slicing_specs {}
  slicing_specs {
    feature_keys: ["age"]
  }
""", tfma.EvalConfig())

eval_shared_model = tfma.default_eval_shared_model(
    eval_saved_model_path='/path/to/saved/model', eval_config=eval_config)

with beam.Pipeline(runner=...) as p:
  _ = (p
       # You can change the source as appropriate, e.g. read from BigQuery.
       # This assumes your data is a TFRecords file containing records in the
       # tf.train.Example format.
       | 'ReadData' >> beam.io.ReadFromTFRecord(
           "/path/to/file/containing/tfrecords")
       | 'ExtractEvaluateAndWriteResults' >>
       tfma.ExtractEvaluateAndWriteResults(
            eval_shared_model=eval_shared_model,
            eval_config=eval_config,
            output_path="/path/for/output"))

# To load and visualize results.
# Note that this code should be run in a Jupyter Notebook.
result = tfma.load_eval_result(
    output_path=eval_config.output_data_specs[0].location)
tfma.view.render_slicing_metrics(result)
```

### Model Validation

To perform model validation against a candiate and baseline, update the config
to include a threshold setting and pass two models to `tfma.run_model_analysis`.

For example:

```python
# Run in a Jupyter Notebook.
from google.protobuf import text_format

eval_config = text_format.Parse("""
  model_specs {
    # This assumes a serving model with a "serving_default" signature.
    label_key: "label"
    example_weight_key: "weight"
  }
  metrics_spec {
    # This assumes a binary classification model.
    metrics { class_name: "AUC" }
    # ... other metrics ...
    thresholds {
      key: "binary_accuracy"
      value: {
        value_threshold {
          lower_bound { value: 0.9 }
        }
        change_threshold {
          direction: HIGHER_IS_BETTER
          absolute { value: -1e-10 }
        }
      }
    }
    # ... other thresholds ...
  }
  slicing_specs {}
  slicing_specs {
    feature_keys: ["age"]
  }
""", tfma.EvalConfig())

eval_shared_models = [
  tfma.default_eval_shared_model(
      model_name=tfma.CANDIDATE_KEY,
      eval_saved_model_path='/path/to/saved/candiate/model',
      eval_config=eval_config),
  tfma.default_eval_shared_model(
      model_name=tfma.BASELINE_KEY,
      eval_saved_model_path='/path/to/saved/baseline/model',
      eval_config=eval_config),
]

eval_result = tfma.run_model_analysis(
    eval_shared_models,
    eval_config=eval_config,
    # This assumes your data is a TFRecords file containing records in the
    # tf.train.Example format.
    data_location="/path/to/file/containing/tfrecords",
    output_path="/path/for/output")

tfma.view.render_slicing_metrics(eval_result)
tfma.load_validation_result(output_path)
```

## Visualization

TFMA evaluation results can be visualized in a Jupyter notebook using the
frontend components included in TFMA. For example:
